Specification Sheet:
- We will use an API to get the news articles to display on the site. The API that is used is up for developer discression but the one I used is newsdata.io
- The webpage should include a header that should have minimally the name of the webpage
- For the filters you should have at least 3 filters that can sort the type of articles that the user wants to see. This can be built into the header or a separate area if  wanted.
- For each article there should be an external link that the user can click on if they wish to do further reading.


Description:
For this lab I wanted to display more than just a row of news changing every so often. This is why I made it 10 rows! I used the New York times API to get the news itself, and got 50 for each type of news over 6 categories. At first I wanted to have a carousel to display the articles but it was not working with the amount of articles that we needed. I tried to fix this for hours but ended up settling with using a grid of articles instead. To get a news looking theme for my site I used an open source template that I have linked below. Overall, I feel that the final product is pretty good and the process of creating it was pretty smooth.
