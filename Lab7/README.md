# Lab 7 - Data Visualization

For this lab I did not to do much due to already having visualizations on my site. My data is all stocks so the only useful visualization for me is a line chart. What I did have to do is change the data to make it come from my database instead of the api which did not cause any problems. I wanted to make a search as well so below the set in stone charts there is a chart that you can search for any stock that I have data for.

Issues: 
None

Timeline:
4/4: finished changing data from API to database and finished lab
